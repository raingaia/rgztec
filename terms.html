    <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
    <p class="meta">Last updated: September 9, 2025</p>

    <p>These Terms of Service (“<strong>Terms</strong>”) govern your access to and use of the RGZTEC marketplace, website, and related services (collectively, the “<strong>Services</strong>”) operated by <strong>Raingaia LLC d/b/a RGZTEC</strong> (“<strong>RGZTEC</strong>,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

    <h3>1) Definitions</h3>
