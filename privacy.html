        <ul>
          <li><strong>Contract</strong> (Art. 6(1)(b)): to provide the Services you request (orders, payouts, support).</li>
          <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> (Art. 6(1)(f)): to secure Services, prevent abuse, improve features, and perform limited analytics.</li>

          <li><strong>Consent</strong> (Art. 6(1)(a)): where required (e.g., certain cookies/marketing). You can withdraw consent at any time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5) Sharing & Disclosures</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Processors</strong>: trusted vendors who help us run the Services (e.g., cloud hosting/CDN, payment processing, email delivery, analytics, error monitoring). They process data under contracts and only on our instructions.</li>
          <li><strong>Other Users</strong>: limited profile or store information may be visible as part of marketplace features (e.g., Seller name, store profile).</li>
          <li><strong>Legal & Safety</strong>: to comply with laws, court orders, tax and regulatory obligations, or to protect rights, safety, and integrity of RGZTEC and users.</li>
          <li><strong>Business Transfers</strong>: in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your data may be transferred consistent with this Policy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6) International Transfers</h3>
        <p>We may process data in the United States and other countries. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards (e.g., EU Standard Contractual Clauses) for transfers from the EEA/UK. You may contact us for a copy of relevant transfer mechanisms.</p>

        <h3>7) Retention</h3>
        <p>We retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide the Services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. Typical examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Account and order records: for the life of the account and as required by tax/accounting laws (often 5–10 years).</li>
          <li>Support tickets/logs: typically 12–36 months, unless needed longer for security/audit.</li>
          <li>If you request deletion, we will anonymize or delete data unless we must keep it to meet legal obligations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>8) Your Rights</h3>
        <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights over your personal data. These can include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Access</strong> to the data we hold about you; <strong>Rectification</strong> of inaccurate data.</li>
          <li><strong>Erasure</strong> (deletion) and <strong>Restriction</strong> of processing in certain cases.</li>
          <li><strong>Portability</strong> of data you provided to us, in a machine-readable format.</li>
          <li><strong>Objection</strong> to processing based on legitimate interests and to direct marketing.</li>
          <li><strong>Withdraw consent</strong> where processing is based on consent.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To exercise rights, email <em>privacy@rgztec.com</em>. We may verify your identity and respond within statutory timeframes. If you are in the EEA/UK, you can also lodge a complaint with your data protection authority.</p>

        <h3>9) California Residents (CCPA/CPRA)</h3>
        <p>If you are a California resident, you have the right to know, access, correct, delete, and opt out of certain “sharing” or “sales” of personal information. We do not sell personal information for money. Some analytics/advertising cookies may be considered “sharing” under CPRA; see <a href="./legal/cookie.html">Cookie Notice</a> for opt-out controls. To submit requests, contact <em>privacy@rgztec.com</em>.</p>

        <h3>10) Cookies & Tracking</h3>
        <p>We use cookies and similar technologies for essential functions (authentication, security) and, where enabled, for analytics. Manage preferences via our <a href="./legal/cookie.html">Cookie Notice</a> and your browser settings. Do Not Track signals may not be recognized by all parts of the Service.</p>

        <h3>11) Security</h3>
        <p>We implement administrative, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect personal data (e.g., encryption in transit, access controls). No method is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h3>12) Children’s Privacy</h3>
        <p>The Services are not directed to children under 16 (or the age of digital consent in your region). We do not knowingly collect personal data from such children. If you believe a child has provided us data, contact us to request deletion.</p>

        <h3>13) Changes to This Policy</h3>
        <p>We may update this Policy from time to time. Material changes will be posted with a new “Last updated” date and, where required, advance notice. Your continued use of the Services after changes means you accept the revised Policy.</p>
