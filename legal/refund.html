    <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
    <p class="meta">Last updated: September 9, 2025</p>

    <p>This Refund Policy applies to purchases made on the RGZTEC marketplace operated by <strong>Raingaia LLC d/b/a RGZTEC</strong> (“RGZTEC”, “we”, “us”). Because Items are digital, downloadable, and clonable, refunds are limited and conditional as described below. This policy forms part of the <a href="../terms.html">Terms of Service</a>, the <a href="./eula.html">Buyer Terms & EULA</a>, and, for Sellers, the <a href="./seller-agreement.html">Seller Agreement</a>.</p>

    <h3>1) General Rule</h3>
    <p>All sales of digital Items are <strong>final</strong>. However, we may provide a refund within the window and conditions below if an eligible issue occurs despite reasonable remediation efforts.</p>

    <h3>2) Refund Window</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>14 calendar days</strong> from the purchase date for eligible claims (Sections 3–4).</li>
      <li>Security-related or non-delivery issues reported immediately may be considered after the window at RGZTEC’s discretion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3) Eligible Reasons</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Non-delivery</strong>: You did not receive access to the Item (download, repository, license key) within a reasonable time after successful payment and you contacted support.</li>
      <li><strong>Corrupted or defective files</strong>: The Item is materially corrupted or technically defective and cannot be replaced after reasonable attempts.</li>
      <li><strong>Advertised feature not working</strong>: A documented, advertised core feature fails to work in a supported environment and the Seller cannot provide a fix or reasonable workaround within a reasonable time.</li>
      <li><strong>Duplicate purchase</strong>: Accidental duplicate orders of the same Item/license type (unused second license).</li>
      <li><strong>Unauthorized charge</strong>: A credible, documented case of unauthorized payment (subject to investigation).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4) Ineligible Reasons</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Change of mind; no longer needed; purchased by mistake but already downloaded/used.</li>
      <li>Incompatibility due to unsupported environments (outside the Item’s stated requirements).</li>
      <li>Custom modifications or integration difficulties beyond stated compatibility.</li>
      <li>Buyer refusal to cooperate in troubleshooting (no logs, no steps to reproduce, etc.).</li>
      <li>Third-party outages, hosting limits, or infrastructure costs.</li>
      <li>Performance expectations not promised or benchmarked in the listing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5) Process</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Contact Support</strong>: Email <em>support@rgztec.com</em> with Order ID, Item name, and a clear description (screenshots/logs). For third-party Items, include Seller’s correspondence if available.</li>
      <li><strong>Troubleshooting</strong>: You must allow the Seller/RGZTEC a reasonable opportunity to investigate and attempt a fix or workaround.</li>
      <li><strong>Decision</strong>: RGZTEC will determine eligibility in good faith based on the evidence and applicable policies. Some cases may require revoking access and deactivating license keys.</li>
      <li><strong>Outcome</strong>: Approved refunds are issued to the original payment method. Processing times depend on the payment processor and bank.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>6) Partial Refunds & Credits</h3>
    <p>Where appropriate, RGZTEC may offer a partial refund, store credit, or exchange (e.g., where part of the bundle works, or a replacement Item is available). Acceptance of a credit/exchange is voluntary.</p>

    <h3>7) Chargebacks</h3>
    <p>Initiating a chargeback without first engaging in our process may delay resolution. Abuse of chargebacks may result in account suspension and license revocation.</p>

    <h3>8) Taxes & Fees</h3>
    <p>Payment processor fees and taxes (VAT/GST/withholding) are typically non-refundable where law permits. If law requires a tax refund, we will follow the applicable procedure.</p>

    <h3>9) Sellers & Cooperation</h3>
    <p>Sellers must cooperate with RGZTEC to resolve buyer issues. RGZTEC may approve refunds to comply with law or policy. RGZTEC may offset payouts to cover approved refunds and chargebacks per the Seller Agreement.</p>

    <h3>10) Fraud & Abuse</h3>
    <p>RGZTEC may refuse or reverse refunds in cases of fraud, misuse, policy violations, or excessive refund requests that indicate abuse.</p>

    <h3>11) Governing Law</h3>
    <p>This policy is governed by the laws of Delaware, USA. Venue for disputes is Wilmington, Delaware, unless otherwise required by law.</p>
