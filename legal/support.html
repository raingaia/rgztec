    <table class="policy-table">
      <thead><tr><th>Severity</th><th>Description</th><th>Target Response</th></tr></thead>

      </tbody>

    <h3>5) How to Request Support</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Open a ticket by emailing <em>support@rgztec.com</em> with your Order ID, Item name/version, environment details, and reproduction steps.</li>
      <li>Attach logs, screenshots, and any error traces. Provide temporary access (if needed and safe) to reproduce issues.</li>
      <li>We may request additional information or suggest upgrades/patches.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>6) Updates & Delivery</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Updates are delivered via download portal/repository access. You are responsible for applying updates.</li>
      <li>Versioning follows semantic versioning where feasible (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).</li>
      <li>Breaking changes are highlighted in release notes and may require migration work (outside support scope unless stated).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>7) Security & Vulnerability Handling</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Report suspected vulnerabilities privately to <em>security@rgztec.com</em> (or via support). Do not publicly disclose before a fix/workaround is available.</li>
      <li>Sellers should target a fix or mitigation for high-severity vulnerabilities within <strong>72 hours</strong> where feasible.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>8) Deprecation & End of Life</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>When a dependency or platform version reaches end-of-life, continued compatibility may require a paid upgrade or new major version.</li>
      <li>Deprecated features will be announced in release notes with reasonable notice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>9) Fair Use</h3>
    <p>We may limit or pause support in cases of abusive behavior, excessive repetitive tickets, or requests that fall outside scope. Support is provided in English during business hours unless otherwise stated.</p>
